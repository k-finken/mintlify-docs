## Test Vale Violations

This was done by the team, and it's probably the best solution we might have. Don't worry about it, we can't fix everything. Maybe we should consider that this might be okay, but I'm not sure. The thing is that it was implemented in a way that could potentially cause issues, and we might need to revisit it at some point in the future when we have more time to properly address the concerns that were raised by various stakeholders who were involved in the process.
